# Audience-Rating

This is a Natural Language Processing project I did due to personal interest.

The dataset has been extracted from an audience appreciation survey which is filled in each day by a panel of respondents. The dataset contains comments from viewers about a show, specifically the answer to the question: “what did you like or did not like about the show”. Respondents are also asked to rate each episode on a scale of 1 to 10. This rating is called the appreciation index (AI score) so each comment is associated with a rating. The datasets also include some basic demographics information and the date of the episode.

Contains all comments from 2017 (28,563) from January to December.

Our aim:

1. Gain insight into these 28,563 responses without having to read and analyse every single response
2. Build word frequency and word cloud graphs
3. Build a model to predict the AI score and raise red flags for potential drops in AI
